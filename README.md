# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- Frontend Developer Test Assignment

Create a simple weather forecast application using React.js. Utilize a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch weather data based on the user's search query. The application should allow users to search for a city and display its current weather conditions, including temperature, weather description, and any other relevant information.

Requirements:

User Interface:
The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface.
Include an input field for users to enter a city name and a button to submit the search query.
Display the current weather conditions for the searched city, including temperature, weather description, humidity, wind speed, etc.
Make sure to handle cases where the city entered by the user is not found or the API request fails.
Functionality:
Users should be able to search for a city and view its current weather conditions.
Implement error handling for cases where the city entered is not found or the API request fails.
Utilize a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch weather data based on the user's search query.
State Management:
Utilize state management in React.js to manage state (Redux) optional, based on candidate's familiarity.
Ensure that changes in the user's search query and the retrieved weather data are reflected in the application's state and UI accordingly.
Styling:
Apply CSS styles to create a visually appealing and responsive layout.
Make sure the application is visually consistent across different screen sizes.
Additional Features (Optional):
Implement additional features like displaying weather forecasts for the upcoming days, allowing users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit, or providing weather icons for different weather conditions.
Submission:

Complete the assignment following the provided requirements.
Once finished, share the link to your repository with us for review.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Code Quality: Clarity, organization, and readability of your code.
Functionality: Implementation of all required features and their correctness.
State Management: Effective use of state management to maintain the application's state.
UI/UX: Intuitiveness, responsiveness, and visual appeal of the user interface.
Bonus Features: Implementation of tests for functions using Jest or Mocha
Note:

You are free to use any additional libraries or tools if you deem necessary.
Make sure to provide clear instructions on how to run your application locally in the README.md file.
Deadline:

You are given 7 days to complete the assignment and submit your solution. -->
